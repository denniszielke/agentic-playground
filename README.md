# AI Agent playground

This project demonstrates agentic concepts, orchestration patterns and functional scenarios using GitHub models and various open souce frameworks like Llama Index, Semantic Kernel, LangChain and AutoGen.

The objective is to try out and learn about the following capabilities of intelligent models:
- Leveraging Tools for model interaction with external systems
- Using visual model to ingest and reason about images using a multimodal model
- Giving up control over the conversation flow using a realtime voice model
- Handing over structured data types like Knowledge Graphs and Onthologies to models 

That gives you the chance to learn how to combine these capabilities by orchestrating them:
- Implementing a ReAct pattern with a single agent to plan and execute iterative tasks
- Forcing the model to use and think in Domain Specific Languages to interact with existing code
- Combining different agent types to solve complex problems through defined interaction patterns
- Tasking a reasoning model to solve complex problems on its own without orchestration

Since there are multiple agentic frameworks and hosting runtimes these will let you see how different collaboration patterns can be implemented:
- Planned agent interactions can be implemented with any agent framework
- Graph based interactions between agents can be implemented with LangGraph
- Dynamic agent interaction can be implemented with MagenticOne/AutoGen
- Event driven agent interaction can be implemented with Llama Index or Semantic Kernel
- Distributed agent platforms can be built with Llama deploy

## What is an Agent?

> ***agent***: 	perceives its environment, makes decisions, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or acquiring knowledge 

![What is an agent](/img/agents.png)

A simple LLM-based chatbot primarily focuses on generating responses based on predefined patterns and language models, often requiring user input to continue the conversation. In contrast, autonomous agents are designed to perform tasks independently, making decisions and taking actions without constant user input, often leveraging advanced AI techniques to achieve their goals.

## Preparation

This project does not require azure resources and support GitHub AI models.

1. Create a personal access token

To authenticate with the model you will need to generate a personal access token (PAT) in your GitHub settings or set up an Azure production key. [GitHub Free AI Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

You can now access AI inference with your GitHub PAT. [Learn more about limits based on your plan](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o-mini/playground#:~:text=Learn%20more%20about%20limits%20based%20on%20your%20plan.). You do not need to give any permissions to the token. 

To use the code snippets below, create an environment variable to set your token as the key for the client code.

If you're using bash:
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```

or rename the file `.env_template` to `.env` and put the value inside the `.env` file. Each python script will load the value from that value automatically.

2. Install dependencies (should be already done when using a GitHub codespace)

```
python -m pip -r requirements.txt
```
